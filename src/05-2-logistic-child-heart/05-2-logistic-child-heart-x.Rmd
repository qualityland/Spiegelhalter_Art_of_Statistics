Data from 1991-1995 are contained in [02-5-child-heart-surgery-1991-x.csv](02-5-child-heart-surgery-1991-x.csv), and taken from [D.J. Spiegelhalter et al., Commissioned Analysis of Surgical Performance Using Routine Data: Lessons from the Bristol Inquiry](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-985X.02021/pdf).

```{r}
 
library(ggplot2)

child.1991 <- read.csv("02-5-child-heart-surgery-1991-x.csv") # read data into dataframe

# leave first row (Bristol) out of the fit
fit=glm(Survivors/Operations ~ Operations, weight=Operations, family="binomial",data=child.1991[-1,])
summary(fit)

predictions=100*predict(fit, data.frame(Operations=0:700), type="response")  # predictions for extreme cases

pred.frame = data.frame(Extremes=0:700,predictions ) # data frame for predictions

p <- ggplot() 
p <- p + geom_point(child.1991, mapping=aes(x=Operations, y=100*Survivors/Operations, col=Hospital), size=3.5) # defines scatter-type plot, plot axis data fields and colour legend data field

Figure 5.2 Fitted logistic regression model for child heart surgery data for under-1s in UK hospitals between 1991 and 1995. Hospitals treating more patients have better survival. The line is part of a curve that will never reach 100%, and is fitted ignoring the outlying data-point representing Bristol.
